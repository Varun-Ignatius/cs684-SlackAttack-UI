test case 1


1.	Valid Login: Enter correct username and password and click on the "Login" button. Verify that user is successfully logged in and redirected to the home page.
2.	Invalid Login: Enter incorrect username and/or password and click on the "Login" button. Verify that an error message is displayed and the user is not able to log in.
3.	Empty fields: Submit the login form without filling in any fields. Verify that error messages are displayed indicating that the fields are required.
4.	Password is case-sensitive: Enter the correct username but with the wrong case for the password. Verify that the user is not able to log in and an error message is displayed.
5.	Username is case-sensitive: Enter the correct password but with the wrong case for the username. Verify that the user is not able to log in and an error message is displayed.
6.	Forgot Password: Click on the "Forgot Password" link and enter a valid email address associated with the account. Verify that a password reset link is sent to the email address.
7.	Invalid Email: Click on the "Forgot Password" link and enter an invalid email address. Verify that an error message is displayed indicating that the email address is not valid.
8.	Remember Me: Check the "Remember Me" checkbox and log in. Close the browser and reopen it. Verify that the user is automatically logged in.
9.	Password Strength: Enter a weak password (e.g. less than 6 characters, all lowercase letters) and verify that an error message is displayed indicating that the password is not strong enough.
10.	Session Timeout: Log in and then wait for the session to time out (e.g. 30 minutes). Verify that the user is automatically logged out and redirected to the login page.








Here are some possible test cases for a sign-up page UI:
1.	Required fields: Verify that all required fields are marked with an asterisk (*) and have clear error messages if not filled in.
2.	Field validations: Verify that input fields (e.g. email, password, phone number) have proper validations to ensure they are in the correct format and meet minimum requirements.
3.	Password strength: Verify that password requirements are clearly stated and enforced (e.g. minimum length, complexity).
4.	Password confirmation: Verify that the password confirmation field matches the password field and has clear error messages if they do not match.

5.	Submit button: Verify that the "submit" button is clearly visible and enabled only when all required fields are filled in correctly.
6.	Consistency: Verify that the sign-up page follows the same design and layout as other pages on the website or application.
7.	Accessibility: Verify that the sign-up page is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g. screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation).
8.	Mobile responsiveness: Verify that the sign-up page is optimized for mobile devices and has a responsive design.
9.	Confirmation message: Verify that a confirmation message is displayed after successful submission of the sign-up form, and that it is clear and informative.














Here are some possible test cases for a sign-in page API:
1.	Valid Login: Send a request with correct username and password, and verify that the response status code is 200 and the user is successfully logged in.
2.	Invalid Login: Send a request with incorrect username and/or password, and verify that the response status code is 401 and the user is not able to log in.
3.	Empty fields: Send a request without providing any fields, and verify that the response status code is 400 and the error message indicates that the fields are required.
4.	Password is case-sensitive: Send a request with the correct username but with the wrong case for the password, and verify that the response status code is 401 and the error message indicates that the password is incorrect.
5.	Username is case-sensitive: Send a request with the correct password but with the wrong case for the username, and verify that the response status code is 401 and the error message indicates that the username is incorrect.
6.	Token expiration: Verify that the token expires after a certain period of time (e.g. 30 minutes), and send a request with an expired token. Verify that the response status code is 401 and the error message indicates that the token is invalid or expired.
7.	Token validity: Verify that the token is valid and can be used for subsequent requests. Send a request with a valid token and verify that the response status code is 200 and the request is successful.
8.	Session management: Verify that the session is managed correctly, and the user is logged out after a certain period of inactivity (e.g. 15 minutes).
9.	Rate limiting: Verify that the API is rate-limited to prevent excessive login attempts (e.g. limit to 5 attempts per minute).
10.	Security: Verify that the API is secure and protected against common attacks (e.g. SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

4.	Clear form: Verify that a "clear" button is available to clear all fields.
5.	Submit button: Verify that the "submit" button is clearly visible and enabled only when all required fields are filled in correctly.
6.	Forgot password: Verify that a "forgot password" link is available to reset the password, and that it redirects to the correct page.
7.	Consistency: Verify that the sign-in page follows the same design and layout as other pages on the website or application.
8.	Accessibility: Verify that the sign-in page is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g. screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation).
9.	Mobile responsiveness: Verify that the sign-in page is optimized for mobile devices and has a responsive design.
10.	Error messages: Verify that error messages are clear and informative, and displayed in a prominent location on the page.















Here are some possible test cases for a sign-up page API:
1.	Valid registration: Send a request with all required fields and verify that the response status code is 200 and the user is successfully registered.
2.	Existing email address: Send a request with an email address that already exists in the system, and verify that the response status code is 409 (conflict) and the error message indicates that the email address is already in use.
3.	Invalid email address: Send a request with an invalid email address (e.g. missing "@" symbol), and verify that the response status code is 400 and the error message indicates that the email address is invalid.
4.	Password requirements: Verify that password requirements are clearly stated and enforced (e.g. minimum length, complexity).
5.	Password confirmation: Verify that the password confirmation field matches the password field, and verify that the response status code is 400 and the error message indicates that the passwords do not match if they are not the same.
6.	Empty fields: Send a request without providing any fields, and verify that the response status code is 400 and the error message indicates that the fields are required.
