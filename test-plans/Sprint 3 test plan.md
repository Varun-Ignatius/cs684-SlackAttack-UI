Test Plan

Introduction:
The Test Plan for the third sprint is to test the first and second deliverables (i.e. to test the Sign-In and Sign-Up APIs and well as the UI pages). Also, to test the Landing Page before and after Logging in to display General Category News which was created for the News App. For third sprint we will test the Landing Page for linked tabs to the articles displayed. Along with testing Home links for each category in the settings page, the Test Plan calls for a test of the articles that are displayed on the home page before and after sign-in and sign-out.
