Objectives:
  
  - To ensure that the news API provides accurate and relevant news articles to end-users.
  - To ensure that the API is easy to use and integrate with other systems.
  - To ensure that the API is secure and efficient.



Scope:

  - The test plan will cover the core functionality of the news API, including article retrieval, search, filtering, and sorting.
  - The test plan will cover the API's performance and security.


Testing Approach:

  - The testing approach will include functional, user interface testing, performance, and security testing.
  - The testing tool will include Postman.
  - The testing will be conducted with testing occurring daily


Test Cases:
  - Functional testing: Verify that the API returns accurate and relevant news articles based on user search queries and filters, and that the articles are displayed in an easy-to-use and visually appealing manner.
  - Performance testing: Verify that the API can handle a large volume of requests without compromising performance or availability, and that the response times are within acceptable limits.
  - Security testing: Verify that the API provides adequate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access, and that the API is not vulnerable to common security threats.
  



Reporting and Communication:
  - Test results will be documented in a test report that includes metrics such as response time, error rate, and throughput.
  - The test results will be reviewed by the development team.
  
  
  By following this test plan, the News API can be thoroughly tested to ensure that it provides accurate and relevant news articles to end-users, while also being secure and efficient.
