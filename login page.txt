Test plan for a login page:

1)Test the user interface:
-Verify that the login page has all the necessary elements, including input fields for username and password, a "login" button, and a "forgot password" link.
-Verify that the user interface is consistent with the application's overall design.
-Verify that the input fields are properly labeled and have placeholder text to indicate their purpose.

2)Test user input validation:
-Attempt to submit the login form with empty fields and verify that appropriate error messages are displayed.
-Attempt to submit the login form with invalid input (e.g. incorrect username or password format) and verify that appropriate error messages are displayed.

3)Test authentication:
-Attempt to log in with a valid username and password and verify that the user is successfully logged in.
-Attempt to log in with an invalid username and password combination and verify that the user is not allowed to log in and an appropriate error message is displayed.

4)Test password reset functionality:
-Click on the "forgot password" link and verify that the user is taken to a password reset page.
-Verify that the password reset page has all the necessary elements, including input fields for the user's email address and a "reset password" button.
-Attempt to reset the password with a valid email address and verify that a password reset email is sent to the user's email address.

5)Test security:
-Verify that the login page is protected by HTTPS and that sensitive information is transmitted securely.
-Attempt to bypass the login form by manually entering the URL of a protected page and verify that the user is redirected to the login page.

6)Test compatibility:
-Verify that the login page is compatible with different browsers and devices, including desktop and mobile devices.

7)Test performance:
-Verify that the login page loads quickly and does not have any performance issues.
-Verify that the login page can handle a high volume of simultaneous login attempts without crashing or slowing down.
-These are just some of the tests that you could include in a test plan for a login page. The exact tests you choose to include may vary depending on the specific requirements of your application.
